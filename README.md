# Metagenomics-and-Microbiome-Analysis
Analyzed 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic datasets from sediment, aquatic, and agricultural samples. Conducted quality control, taxonomic profiling (QIIME2, Kraken2), diversity analysis (alpha/beta), and data visualization. Explored microbial shifts for bioremediation potential.
